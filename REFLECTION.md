# Cat Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Seeing that document.getElementById acts like a bridge between the HTML on the page and the JavaScript logic running in the back. When I saw how changing textContent updated what I saw in the browser, the connection made a lot more sense. 

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I changed the project from a cookie clicker to a cat clicker when I couldn't easily find a good cookie monster emoji. Plus, cats are pretty fun subject on the internet. The milestone messages are playful and fun and reflect the idea of cats loving attention, but only on their terms. 

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
One thing that caught me was accidentally using = instead of === in an if statment, which caused milestones to trigger immediately. Debugging that helped reinforce how careful you have to be with conditionals in event-driven code. 

## What personal twist did you add?
Changing to a cat theme was a personal choice, along with changing the background and messages as the click count increased. It made the project seem more like a small game than a basic counter. 

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
This kind of interaction is all over the internet. We see it in social media likes, upvotes, reaction buttons, and mobile games that rely on click events, counters, and milestone-based feedback to keep users engaged.
